Description
============

A simple dev board for the XMEGA E5 microcontroller.  Provides AVcc conditioning, a PDI header, a crystal oscillator, and access to all I/O pins except port R (which is used for the crystal). Ports A and C are available in a DIP layout for breadboarding, but to save space port D is on a 2-row header.

Just ordered from [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com).  Will probably order the MCUs this week.
