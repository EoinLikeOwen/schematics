Description
============

A simple dev board for the XMEGA E5 microcontroller.  Provides AVcc conditioning, a PDI header, a crystal oscillator, and access to all I/O pins except port R (which is used for the crystal). Ports A and C are available in a DIP layout for breadboarding, but to save space port D is on a 2-row header.

Status

Ordered, assembled, in use.  I've been using it for a few months now and am pretty happy with it.  There's one annoyance though, and it was one I expected.  The ISP header being over a floating corner of the board, sometimes the board moves when I push the cable connector onto the ISP header.
