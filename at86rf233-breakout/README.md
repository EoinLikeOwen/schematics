Description
============

This is a schematic and layout for a small breakout board for Atmel's AT86RF233 wireless transceiver.  This is the first RF layout I've ever attempted, so I'll be very surprised if it doesn't have some interference issues.

I have received 3 of these boards from [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com) and a solder screen from [OHARA RP](http://ohararp.com) but I have not yet purchased the parts to assemble them - I will probably order them this week.
