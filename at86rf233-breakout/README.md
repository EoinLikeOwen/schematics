Description
============

This is a schematic and layout for a small breakout board for Atmel's AT86RF233 wireless transceiver.  This is the first RF layout I've ever attempted, so I'll be very surprised if it doesn't have some interference issues.

Built these, but I was too sloppy with my solder paste application and haven't had a chance to rework them.  Maybe someday.  For now this is an abandoned project.
