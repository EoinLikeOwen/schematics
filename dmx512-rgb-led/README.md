Description
============

First adaptation of the [RGB LED floodlight](http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Control-Waterproof-Flood-Different/dp/B005KYOE2Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378138643&sr=8-1&keywords=10w+rgb+led+floodlight), and precursor to [this wireless version](https://github.com/bondians/vTree-2.9).

This layout worked, and the prototype also had pull-down resistors on the gates of the MOSFETs.

Status
========

I originally wanted to use a simple RS-485 protocol, and built a working DMX512 prototype, but decided to go with wireless instead because weatherproof data connectors are ludicrously expensive and I don't want to hard-wire the final installation.
