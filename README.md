Overview
=========

This repository contains miscellaneous schematics and PCB layouts.  Some are projects I have built (or designed and decided not to build for one reason or another) and others were simple exercises for learning the tools used.

I will try to keep READMEs up-to-date in each project describing which each one is and, if the design was built, how it went.  

Currently all design files are for gEDA, but I will likely experiment with other tools soon too.

Public domain
==============

All designs are free to use (I release them to the public domain) - see the file UNLICENSE for more details, including the oh-so-important disclaimer of warrantees.

BOMs
=====

Several projects include BOMs, but not in the traditional pile-of-excel style.  They are Haskell source files, describing the BOM and providing functions to analyze and extract information from them.  They are mainly meant for my own personal use and I may change them without notice, so I'm not going to write any documentation now but feel free to ask for help if you'd like to use them.
