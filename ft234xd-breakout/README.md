============

A breadboard-compatible breakout for the FT234XD, a new very tiny USB to serial adapter chip from FTDI.  Prioritizes size over a lot of other stuff, but manages to have enough space to route signals to a more memorable layout anyway.

Ordered a set from OSH Park.  This is a very rough prototype - it's my first-ever kicad project, so it very well may be totally jacked up.  I spent no time whatsoever working on the silk, but if I'm happy with the functionality when I get it I'll polish it up.
