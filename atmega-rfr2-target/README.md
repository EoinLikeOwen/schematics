Description
=============

A dev board schematic for the ATmega RFR2 series of RF SOCs.  There is a PCB file but it doesn't have anything in it yet other than the components and netlist.

Status
========

Schematic only, I decided that since I have no RF layout experience I should play with the cheaper AT86RF233 transceiver instead.
