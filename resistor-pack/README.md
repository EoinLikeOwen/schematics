Description
============

22 MÎ© through-hole resistors appear to be made of solid gold or something.  SMD ones are much, much cheaper.  I wanted to put together a low-budget makey-makey clone, so i need a bunch of them.  This layout is for a pull-up network in a 20 pin 300 mil DIP package, using 1608 (metric) resistors.

Status
=======

Ordered, assembled, works as expected.
