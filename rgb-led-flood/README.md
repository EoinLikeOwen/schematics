============

Schematic capture of an [RGB LED floodlight](http://www.amazon.com/Remote-Control-Waterproof-Flood-Different/dp/B005KYOE2Q/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1378138643&sr=8-1&keywords=10w+rgb+led+floodlight).  See also [this project](https://github.com/bondians/vTree-2.9), which is a replacement for the guts of that light.

A few parts of the schematic are guesswork, and the main IC is unmarked - this was mostly just an exercise in learning `gschem`.
